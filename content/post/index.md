Anu was one of the best cooks I had ever come across. Her recipes were so delicious that our office colleagues would line up when she opened her lunch bag. Sruthi and Thaman, her lucky kids, always had their food served fresh and delicious. And so did their dad. Anu always cooked a little extra, just like my mom. She didn't want to run out of food when someone wanted a little more. I was curious to know what she did with the leftovers.

So I asked, and she said, "I have them the next day for breakfast or lunch, simple!" I couldn't help myself from asking her back, "What about the others?"

Anu replied, "Oh, I make them fresh breakfast every day. My husband would start complaining if I served him leftovers. And my kids wouldn't touch them. They would even choose to starve."

"Well, that doesn't sound good, does it? You are just like my mom," I grunted. "You cook the most delicious food, and you should have it before them."

Anu looked puzzled; she took a moment to respond. "I am a mother, a wife, and these are the little sacrifices I make for my family."

The chat continued, "Did your mother sacrifice too?" Anu was quick to respond, "Of course, she did. She always served me fresh food, but these are little things. Why do you take it so seriously?"

"Do you get it?" I asked.

Anu: "Get what? I don't understand."

Now I had to explain to her, "Well, it's right there. By sacrificing, your mom taught you the wrong lesson. She didn't realize that by sacrificing her fresh food, she taught you how to sacrifice." I paused for a moment. She was quiet, and I took that as acknowledgment. I continued, "You are not just a mother and a wife. You are a Woman with a Dream."

There was an awkward moment of silence. Anu broke it. "Not every dream comes true. I wanted to open a restaurant. Look at me, here in front of computers all day."

I wanted to help her. I knew that was her dream long ago; she had said this a dozen times. "Kids don't learn from what you teach. They learn from what you do. You sacrifice your dreams for them, and they, in turn, sacrifice theirs for their kids. And it goes on, a merry-go-round, except it's not merry." And I ended with a question, as usual, "Why didn't you follow your dreams?"

Anu returned to realization, "Wait a minute, do you think I didn't follow my dreams because my mom ate the leftovers?"

She had it. "Exactly! If you make the best choices for you, that's what your kids will learn. It's not about food; it's a practical lesson on decision-making."

"Being a woman should not stop you from following your dreams. You shouldn't be here. Instead, you should be working on your dream, your restaurant."

Anu is not a fictional character. She is every "mother or wife" who sacrifices herself for the so-called "family." Bonds within families don't get stronger by sacrificing the little things. Instead, they get strong by sharing. Don't just share happiness and joy; share your pain, doubts, worries, sorrows, and, most importantly, the leftovers and YOUR DREAM.

You Are a Woman with a Dream.
