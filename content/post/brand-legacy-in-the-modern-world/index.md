Parle - GGluco biscut produced a brand introduced in 1930's rebranded its packaging with an illustration of a baby in 1960's. After 65 years since the introduction, the illustration has not changed, the packaging has sublte changes but the core branding, the baby illustration still remainds. its still a staple product across india. if you go to a random petti shop and ask for "biscut Packet" , you are most likely handed a parle-g biscut pack. i recently cliked this pick in an indian grocery store in Ohio.

when 90% of the start ups are failing , despite having the cutting edge modern tools that one would never have had access to decades ago, how did this brand not only survive but thrive, most importantly without rebranding?
a lots of lessons,

you dont have to modernize if you dont need to. Pargle g was designed and marked to meet a low income blue collar people who had kids. the produce was cheap, delicious and met the needs of a cranky kid. the market still exists today. why should they rebrand or invest in modernization?


Simplicity - the product itself
