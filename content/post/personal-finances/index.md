someone very close to me met with an tragetic accident, lost his wife, his son with a broken shoulders. once a happy family, brough their dream car, mortgaged a beautiful home that they can call theirs, a 8-5 govt job, happy little kid, loving wife, what could possibly go wrong?

Ever wondered what would happen when you die? Or what if you meet with a terrible accident that killed your wife, seriously injured your kid and you are charged with homicide?

Relax! Gods grace you and your family are alive , happy  and healthy reading this, but that’s not the case with my dear friend. This blog is about the aftermath of a tragic accident and a opiniated blog on personal finance.


lots of lessons to learn

Mortgage piling up with a 7% interest rate , credit carts running out of limit, child care ripping off your pockets is all you have left when you are unemployed, disabled or even worse, when you are falsely charged and in custody.

There are thngs that you cant prevent, such as natural disaster, certain accidents and fate. But you can control? your personal finances. Its really asking a simple question when you make decisions - do you need it or want it?

Let me give you an example. Lets say you are earning 130,000$ + 20K bonus and you partner is earning another 80K and you have a single child

lets talk about nomination, will and trust


lets talk about term insurance

lets also talk about investments


and finally lets talk about creating a central repo for family to have access to each other's account. we need to spend more time on this.

I wonder if we need to answer a whole bunch of questions

What is the probability that you will die in a road accident? Assuming that you commute 2 hts a day, you have .016% chance of dying in a year, but over a 20 year career it goes to .66% i.e 1 in 152

Considering serious injuries, anually, Annual probability of medically consulted injury: Approximately 2.45% or 1 in 41, over a 20 year period, 6/10 people meet an accident

Assuming that you are incapacitated, does your family have access to financial and professional help?

Will they have access to your bank?
Do they know who to contact in your workplace
