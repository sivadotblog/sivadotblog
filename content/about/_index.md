    <h2 class="card-title">Siva Rajadurai: Architect of Data Dreams</h2>
    Greetings! I'm Siva Rajadurai, currently navigating the exciting world as a Principal Data Platform Enterprise Architect. Think of me as a digital architect, but instead of bricks and mortar, I build with data and cloud!
    <br>
    <br>
    For over 16 years, I've been diving deep into the fascinating realm of technology leadership, passionately crafting scalable data and cloud platforms. My mission? To drive real business value and push the boundaries of innovation. It's about transforming how organizations operate, one ingenious solution at a time.
    <br>
    <br>
    My fascination with data and tech sparked early â€“ picture a school kid already building applications and coding away! This early passion has fueled my career, driving me to design software architectures that not only cut costs but also make a positive impact on people's lives.
    <br>
    <br>
    Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege of architecting and delivering numerous data platform solutions, intricate integration designs, and innovative cloud services. These aren't just abstract concepts; they're the engines that power organizational change. Currently, at Humana, I spearhead the enterprise cloud data platforms, wielding tools like Databricks, Snowflake, Prefect Workflow Orchestration, Azure Synapse, and Azure Data Factory. Together with my amazing team, we've achieved significant milestones: real cost savings, boosted efficiency, and groundbreaking data solutions.

    <h2 class="card-title">A Glimpse into the Dataverse</h2>
    The evolution of the data platform stack in the last two decades has been mind-blowing, and trust me, the revolution isn't slowing down!  One of the cool things about being in data integration early on was getting a sneak peek at practically every tech out there. Want to chat about the ancient mysteries of AS/400 or the cutting-edge magic of uniform delta 3.0 formats?  Or perhaps reminisce about the days of mainframe VSAM files? I've seen it all! My adventures in data platforms have taken me through some incredible companies: Humana, L.L. Bean, Tata Consultancy Services, and Target Corporation.

    <h2 class="card-title">Fun Fact & Invitation</h2>
    Here's a fun tidbit: Back in my 12-year-old days, fueled by pure curiosity, I designed an entire website using just HTML and JavaScript. The funny part? I was supposed to be learning Microsoft Office 2000 at the computer institute!  Oops!  Curiosity does lead to interesting detours, doesn't it?
