    <h2 class="card-title">My Journey</h2>
    From tinkering with databases in my early teens to leading data platform initiatives at a Fortune 40 company, my journey with data has been nothing short of exhilarating. I'm passionate about data platforms, data engineering, and AI â€“ the very topics that have defined my 16-year career. The platforms we build today are empowering hundreds of talented individuals, and honestly, being at the forefront of this Gen AI revolution is a dream come true.

    <h2 class="card-title">What I Do</h2>
    I have witnessed the astounding transformation of the data platform stack over the last two decades. And I don't see that transformation stopping anytime soon. In fact, I predict the pace of change is about to accelerate even further. One of the perks of being in data integration in the early days gave me a peek at every possible technology out there. I can talk about things as legacy as AS/400, or the most recent developments around uniform delta 3.0 formats. Oh, remember those mainframe VSAM files?

    My 16-year journey in data platforms has been fulfilling, and I've had the opportunity to work for some great companies along the way:

    - Humana
    - L.L. Bean
    - Tata Consultancy Services
    - Target Corporation

    I am passionate about designing and building software architectures to reduce costs and improve the lives of others. Throughout my career, I have architected and delivered several data platform solutions, integration designs, and cloud services that have transformed the way organizations operate.

    <h2 class="card-title">Fun Fact</h2>
    Fun fact about me: I designed an entire website using just HTML and JavaScript when I was a 12-year-old. I actually got caught by the tutors because I joined the computer institute for learning Microsoft Office 2000. Well, curious minds, I guess.

    Through my blog, I hope to share my knowledge and experience with you and learn from you. Don't hesitate to write to me at hello@siva.blog.

    Join me, together, let's innovate, inspire, and invigorate.
