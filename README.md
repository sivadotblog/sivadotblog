### üóëÔ∏è GitHub Action Workflow for Deleting Branches

We have implemented a new GitHub action workflow to automatically delete branches that are already merged and have not been touched for 30 days. This helps in keeping the repository clean and manageable.

#### How to Configure and Use the Workflow

1. **Create the Workflow File**: Add a new file named `delete-branches.yaml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
2. **Define the Schedule**: The workflow is set to run daily to check for branches that meet the criteria.
3. **Use GitHub Script**: The workflow uses `actions/github-script` to delete branches that are merged and not touched for 30 days.
4. **Log Unusable Branches**: The workflow will also log and state unusable branches.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your repository remains clean and free of stale branches.
