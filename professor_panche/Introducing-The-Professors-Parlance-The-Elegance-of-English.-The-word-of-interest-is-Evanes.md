[Speaker] Evanescence. In The Return of the Native, Thomas Hardy writes, "She was immediately angry at having betrayed, even to herself, the possible evanescence of her passion for him." The possible evanescence. Now, I've caught an esteemed faculty member at the University of Cambridge pronounce it 'ev-uh-ness-unce', evanescence. So you might be better off following his drift. Though for me, it has and will always remain evanescence. The gradual disappearance or fading of something, especially something intangible or beautiful, like love, or what one thought was love. It might have been an obsession, fleeting, bearing an intensity that was more illusory than genuine. Evanescence. The fading of feelings. The realization that one might have perhaps overestimated the depth of their passion. It speaks to the complexities of human emotions, the impermanence of these emotions, their imperfections, and the ease with which they can often dissipate, leaving behind only traces, like light wisps of the memory of their intensity. Evanescence holds as true for an age-old romance as it does for someone one might have just encountered. One's feelings for someone, someone whom they've loved through the ages, might now seem to be, regretfully, fading. Evanescence. It might as easily be for a romantic infatuation, powerful while it bears hold, yet impermanent. Passion that is fragile. Emotions that are transient. That is evanescence.
