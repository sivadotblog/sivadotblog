[Professor Panache] Let me be perfectly clear. Travel for me has never been merely a matter of getting from A to B. Every gentleman of unquestionable taste and worldly wisdom should whittle his travel necessities down to a bare minimum. These are my seven samurai. Some seductive, some stayed objects that whisper, and on occasion scream, “sophisticated globetrotter.” Now, whether I'm flying private to Saint Tropez, or I'm roughing it out in a first-class Emirates suite, these are always by my side.

I prefer to let airport immigration know that I'm not just visiting, but that I've arrived. And to this, my chubby passport sits handsomely in its Goyard sheath. Now, a passport without a cover is basically a box of napkins with some immigration stamps. In fact, if my travel documents aren't swaddled in Goyard or Hermes, I would ask myself, what am I even doing at immigration?

Moments of beauty deserve to be captured, but not with a camera on one's phone like some philistine. You see, photography shouldn't be reduced to digital peasantry. Moments that must be retained for posterity, I would shoot only with my Leica camera. It's not about megapixels, it's about gravitas. It makes every frame I shoot look like it belongs in a MoMA retrospective.

Yes, my Stanley mug is rugged, and yes, it's more likely to be seen in the burly hands of someone named “Chuck” who chops wood for fun. But fill this with a single origin, hand-ground Guatemalan pour over, and this mug magically transforms into an iconic accessory. An industrial strength shell that doubles up as a weapon, and surefire, though sometimes unwelcome conversation starter.

Now, most wear sunglasses to shield their daintiness from the sun. I wear my Jacques Marie Mage sunglasses to shield from the paparazzi, subpar design, and that flimsy plastic excuse for eye frames that most of humanity seem to accept as their fate. These aren't accessories, they're armor. These shades don't block UV rays, they block people.

I like to announce my arrival three seconds before I do, as you all well know, with a scent that evokes aristocratic rebellion. And that's what this, and rather often, I smell like. Acqua di Parma Colonia Mirra. Like a posh gentleman's club, minus the cigar smoke and chauvinist posturing. I wear it to remind people that chivalry is not dead, it's just flying first class.

While I don't smell, I love the aroma of a printed book as much as the other gentleman, but I refuse to have my staff hauling Tolstoy in hardcovers through airport security. Therefore, a Kindle. Do not mistake this for an iPad, I'm not that uncivilized. Nothing says culture like highlighting Proust while sipping champagne and pretending to understand Proust. It's loaded with about 1200 unread classics I swear I'll get to by the next flight.

And the return of the G, a Goyard Bouget PM trolley case. This luggage doesn't merely carry clothes, it carries legacy. Watching it glide across a marble airport floor is like viewing French film noir in slow motion. Do I care that it doesn't fit in most overhead bins? I leave that be to a kindly flight attendant to figure out. And there you have my seven. Some men pack light, I pack luxuriously. After all, you can't spell “essential” without “S-T-Y-L-E”, right?
