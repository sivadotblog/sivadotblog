Here is the transcript of the attached video "What-stops-men-from-opening-up-emotionally.mp4":

Gentlemen, gather round. Put down your single malt, pause your grunting. We must speak about, well, speaking. Preferably in complete sentences like verbs and feelings. You know those things that we were taught to suppress somewhere between "be a man" and "boys don't cry!" But we men do say things, right? "Sup, nice, all good, bro." Such a rich tapestry of dialogue, Shakespeare must be weeping in his grave. But what about emotional expression? The sacred art of saying, "I'm not okay?" "Men don't talk" is quite simply an excuse for emotional constipation. Stuffing a keema naan is wonderful, but stuffing your feelings within, that'll just make you miserable, awkward, and occasionally terrifying when you do finally explode. Most likely at not being able to find your remote control. Men need to ditch this "silent and strong" facade. Silence is no longer golden. It's a soggy Parle-G biscuit at the bottom of your half-full teacup. We were taught that silence is stoic, that brooding is sexy, that emotions are best served bottled like a fine scotch, but even that scotch needs to breathe. It is time, gentlemen, to sit down with a friend (or heaven forbid, a therapist), and say the unsayable. "I'm overwhelmed." "I feel like I'm not enough." "I think I peaked in college, and even then, it was at kho-kho." You see, talking is not weak or unmanly. It's the emotional equivalent of bench-pressing a rhinoceros. You want a shot of courage? Try telling your bud that you're scared. That takes more guts than trying that hot sauce made from those tiny naga chilies. What are they called? Anyway, we're human beings with hearts, minds, and that one unresolved conversation from 2012. So speak, not in grunts, but in glorious human nuance, because one of the toughest things a gentleman can do is actually talk. So I implore you, speak, share, try even, preferably, gentlemen, into a high-quality monogrammed handkerchief.
