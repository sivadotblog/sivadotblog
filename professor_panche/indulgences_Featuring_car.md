[Unknown Speaker A] Ladies and gentlemen, there are cars that don't just carry you. They carry you through time. This is one such carriage, built in the roaring twenties, an era where motoring was a genuine art form. The Rolls-Royce Phantom 1 Tourer. This isn't merely a motorcar. It's a poem written in steel, leather, and wood.

[Unknown Speaker B] Whispered into existence by a team of British master craftsmen of the illustrious House of Barker, who most definitely wore monocles and argued about Shakespeare while they busily polished its hood. This is a vision not to be merely driven, but to be experienced, like a well-aged whiskey or a scandal at a country estate. Glance, if you please, at the exterior. Lines smoother than a diplomat's apology, curves that would make a Roman sculpture sob, and nickel gleam loud enough to bestow vision for a fruit bat. And the interior, more a gentleman's cigar room that accidentally learned to drive. The leather, so serenely comforting, it likely writes poetry when parked. The wood, a burled walnut, polished to the luster of aged cognac and scented faintly of aristocracy. And the engine, a beast of dignified restraint. It does not roar, it murmurs. In a world that blithers over speed and pours over hideous touchscreen dashboards, this chariot whispers, because some journeys, the best ones, are not measured in miles per hour, but in gasps, sighs, and stares. So therefore, raise your monocles, adjust your cravats, and celebrate the Rolls-Royce Phantom 1 Tourer.
