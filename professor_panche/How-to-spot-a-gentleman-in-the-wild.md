[Unknown Speaker A] What are the immediate signs that one is in the company of a gentleman? VP4?

[Professor Panache] You know VP, when I was younger, I felt a gentleman was someone who dressed well, could converse like a dream and was very charming. But as the decades turned, I learned that there was so much more to it. This is what I've learned VP and it's actually quite simple. Observe humans and look for these tells. Politeness, respectfulness, for whoever they're with and wherever they are. Respect isn't reserved just for important people, it's for everyone. It's often easy to overlook some people in your life, but a true gentleman lifts everyone up. That's a display of real character. Then there's this quiet confidence about their carriage. No bragging, no making a scene, no matter what. Confidence is steady and humble. It speaks without saying a word. Then they'll always listen more than they speak. They'll give whoever they're with their complete attention. They will take care of their appearance. Not to impress anyone, but because it reflects respect for the self and for those around them. It doesn't matter if they're in a suit or shorts. There'll always be a certain neatness about how they're turned out. A gentleman will always be considerate. He'll hold the door, offer a hand, smile at a stranger, give another a genuine compliment. Be there for the other, irrespective of gender. But there's also another integral facet, one that can't really be observed. The real test of a gentleman is how he acts when no one is watching. This only the person himself would know. And this determines the grade of a genuine gentleman according to me. Also VP, being a gentleman isn't about perfection. It's about striving to be better every single day. So keep striving, keep smiling.

This transcript addresses the question: how to spot a gentleman.
