[Unknown Speaker A] Professor, what is the difference between confidence and arrogance?

[Unknown Speaker B] Ramit.

[Unknown Speaker B] Ramit, the foundation of confidence is built upon truth. Confidence is having this calm recognition of one's own abilities. It says that you know your value and have no need whatsoever to prove it to anyone or to announce it to the world. This confidence does not need any sort of validation. It's often taken years, if not decades, of learning, preparation, failure, and all the experiences that come with these. A gentleman's confidence will not overshadow anyone, definitely not intentionally. In fact, one of the key essential facets of a confident gentleman would be to make the one he's facing feel important, to feel valued.

Now, confidence and arrogance might have somewhat of a similar sheen or appearance on the surface, but they're actually far removed from one another. If confidence comes built upon a firm foundation, arrogance comes from emptiness. It reflects insecurity. It is rude. Most often it will scream and it usually is loudly performative. The arrogant man bears this need to always believe that he's right, to be constantly seen, to be praised all the time for his greatness. And he will not hesitate in belittling another in this need for attention.

In the unlikely event that a confident gentleman diminishes the other, there will be an entirely reasonable reason for his action. A confident one will uplift. An arrogant one will compete. Confidence will invite respect, arrogance will demand it. Confidence will be rooted in humility, arrogance will be cocky. A confident gentleman listens more than he speaks. He learns. He's comfortable being wrong because his identity isn't fragile. He will not try to dominate a conversation. He knows when he should remain silent, when he should step in with a question, and most importantly when to let the other enjoy that spotlight. In fact, he enjoys others basking in their achievements.

Arrogance, on the other hand, will try and occupy every available space in the room. Confidence is elegant. Arrogance is loud. It's the difference to my mind between being turned out in a well-tailored navy blue suit and looking like a walking Formula One car.

This transcript explores the topic: On confidence and arrogance.
