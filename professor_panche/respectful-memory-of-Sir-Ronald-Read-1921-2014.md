[Professor Panache] Brattleboro, Vermont. Have you heard of this town? Most haven't. And in this town that most haven't heard of, lived a man who most of its residents barely noticed, whose name most didn't know. His name was Ronald Read. He was an old man. He'd wear the same faded flannel shirt most days of the week. He'd always have this wool hat on, even in the summers. Like most older folk, he walked with a slight stoop. And every morning, he swept the floors of a departmental store. He'd started off as a gas station attendant, a job that he'd stuck with for 25 years. Then he transitioned to the role of a janitor, a role that he played for the next 17 years. He lived alone, fixed things himself, drove a used Toyota Yaris. He clipped coupons every week, never spent a cent that he didn't have to. Through most, he was simply invisible, ordinary, forgettable even. But Ronald Read wasn't what he seemed. You see, Ronald had a secret, something no one, not a single of his few friends knew about. Every evening, after work, he'd sit at his small kitchen table, turn on an age-battered lamp, and here Ronald read, not fiction, not the newspaper, but company filings, annual reports, market trends. Ronald Read had spent night upon night teaching himself how to invest. He understood the nuances, studied the discipline, quietly, patiently, over decades. He didn't chase the stock market. He chose carefully, bought shares of solid, dividend-paying companies, and then he held on for decades. He wasn't a genius, he wasn't born into money. He simply focused and remained unshakably consistent.

And then in 2014, Sir Ronald Read passed on at the age of 92. But he didn't just leave. He left behind something that made a city gasp. Sure, he left behind a small somewhat decrepit house and a used car, but he also left behind over $8 million. Let that sink in. A janitor, a man who swept floors for a living, was a multi-millionaire. But he didn't keep it. He didn't hoard it. He gave it all away. $4.8 million to the local hospital, $1.2 million to the town library, and the remaining millions to similar causes that mattered. Sir Ronald Read gave it all to the very community that had barely even noticed him when he was present, and yet he wanted to make this very community richer. He proved that wealth isn't loud, that greatness doesn't need to shout, that you don't need a suit or an office or a title to make a difference. All you need is quiet purpose, a steady discipline, calm hands, love for the other, a smile for the other, even if they don't notice or share one in return. Sir Ronald Read swept floors while he was here with us, and when he left, he quietly swept us all off our feet.

This transcript is a tribute to the life and legacy of Sir Ronald Read, highlighting the qualities of a genuine gentleman.
