[Unknown Speaker A] Best of all, I was betrayed by someone very close to me. I felt very hurt and disrespected. Looking back, I did not react well and behaved in a manner I am not proud of. How would a gentleman handle this situation of being betrayed or disrespected? Adit.
[Unknown Speaker B] Stillness. That's your solution, Adit. Make silence your strategy. Betrayal tests your self-worth. Disrespect will test your self-control. Your natural reaction would be fury, to seek out revenge, to show them exactly how it feels like. Remember this, a gentleman doesn't match the faulty party's energy, ever. He's the one who sets the tone. This need to explode, to create a scene even in the presence of others. And in light of the fact that we have digital avatars and live in digital times, you might be immediately prone to venting purposefully on social media. It's paramount, particularly at this stage, to choose peace over performance. Don't try to damage their image. What they did reveal something about them. What you do in this moment in response reveals everything about you. A gentleman keeps his dignity and the dignity of others, even when they don't deserve it entirely, intact. The most essential rule to follow at such times, and I'm repeating myself, Adit, is to observe stillness. Stay calm. Process what's happened. And while you're processing, let your silence speak. This silence of yours will speak far more loudly than your retaliation ever could. As you process, establish with a high degree of objectivity why they behaved like they did. Do not assume or simply arrive at conclusions based on hearsay. Seek out the complete picture. Was it a slip on their part? Was it a misunderstanding? Or was it plain, pure spite? If it was on account of their ignorance, talk to them and make them aware. If this was on account of their carelessness or silliness, confront them, but confront them privately. If this was deliberate, though, walk away, calmly, silently, with finality. You see, walking away isn't weakness. It's irrefutable evidence that you hold your standards high. Silence and distance, to my mind, are the sharpest responses a gentleman can ever give. Now, being disrespected also allows you to take a much-needed pause. Refine your circle and resume this never-ending march towards becoming even more secure in your self-worth. Remember, to embrace rage and to seek revenge might come naturally, but both rage and revenge are noisy. You know what's quiet? Growth. And its results are several times more powerful. So grow powerfully, Adit. Realize your potential and soon your absence in some circles will start echoing louder than your words ever possibly could. Not that it would matter to you in the least at that point in time. You see, a gentleman doesn't prove a point. He becomes the point.
