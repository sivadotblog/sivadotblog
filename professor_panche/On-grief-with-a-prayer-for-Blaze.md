[Unknown Speaker A] Professor, my name is Harit. I lost my dog two days ago. His name was Blaze, and he was a gem. What does a gentleman deal with grief?
[Professor Panache] Harit, I'm very sorry for your loss. Though I never had the privilege of meeting Blaze, I already know that he was the goodest boy in the world, like they always are. Now about grief. The way I see it, grief is the price one pays for love. And of all the love that a human might be fortunate enough to receive, nothing will ever come close to that which they receive from a pup. It's ever-present, it's unconditional, and no matter how much you love that pup, that pup's love for you will always be unmatchable. This unbearable grief that you're experiencing right now, undoubtedly, it's a testament to the depth of your bond. It's proof that your heart loved Blaze and loved him wholeheartedly. Your world right now is likely seeming tilted. Nothing quite seems right, and that's completely natural. It's okay to feel broken right now. Take your time. Let this ache that you're experiencing consume you. Don't fear it. Don't challenge it. Don't try to contain it. Let yourself feel it, every last bit of it. It's crucial for you as a gentleman, perhaps conditioned to think otherwise, to know that there's no need to and you shouldn't have to hide your tears. Strength, in my view, lies not in holding them back, but in allowing them to fall when they must. You must remember that there's no weakness nor shame in embracing sorrow. In these moments of vulnerability, though, let those who care for you be near you. Try and if possible, remain in the presence of those who listen more than they speak. When you need silence and you will need silence, let it embrace you completely. Remember that you don't have to be strong every minute. You don't need to have all the answers, and you don't have to hold yourself together at all times. Grief is not neat. It doesn't come with squared edges or tucked neatly into a circle, and it shouldn't be. The thing that I understand about grief is that it changes form with the passage of time. Even if it never leaves you, and chances are it will not, it can soften into something that you carry with you with a quiet strength. In time, the memories that now bring you tears will make you smile. When you take Blaze's name, you will feel more love than you will feel hurt. Until that time comes, Harit, be kind to yourself. Take care of yourself. Breathe, eat. If sleep is a challenge, rest. And remember this. What you shared with Blaze is not gone. It's a part of you now and forever. Part of the gentleman you already are, and the even finer one that you'll become. Carry that memory of Blaze well, Harit.
