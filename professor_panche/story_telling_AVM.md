**Video 1: AQO3trhL0Mvx-SXlP-fD5Y_fcl3QoZXzWN-ufQQ3Njn__HgXtrcMfIF6vP9qQqSt5cneJFL9PT0tzvgNBVybvXwbLR-JEx7cZm5eoCo.mp4**

> **Arvind Vijay Mohan:**
> Can a single finger build one of the world’s mightiest bridges? You don’t think so, right? But it’s true.
>
> John was a reputed bridge builder, but his latest design was so audacious in scale that everyone thought he was mad. But he was convinced that his design was fully feasible. His perseverance finally paid off and a group of investors bankrolled the project.
>
> But within days of launch, John suffered a grievous fatal injury. The future of the project was now uncertain.
>
> So his 32-year-old son, Washington, took over as the chief engineer. He was fully dedicated to realizing his father’s vision and worked tirelessly with the crew. In fact, one of the dangerous tasks that he absolutely insisted on doing was diving in pressurized chambers to the bottom of the river himself.
>
> Doing this repeatedly resulted in a decompression illness that left him tragically paralyzed. It seemed likely that this bridge would never be completed.
>
> But this is when Emily, Washington’s wife, stepped in. Though immobile, Washington realized that he could move one finger. So he painstakingly devised a code with Emily using that one finger that only she could understand. From their apartment, Washington could see in the distance the incomplete bridge.
>
> He insisted that Emily take charge, even though she had no experience or expertise. With only that single finger, Washington typed out complex instructions that Emily would then share on a daily basis with the site engineer. A routine that the couple would follow for the following 13 years.
>
> Fourteen years after work was initiated, this spectacular Brooklyn Bridge, long considered one of the greatest structures ever built, was unveiled.
>
> Still standing strong 140 years on, a testament to human perseverance and the love of Emily and Washington.[^1]

> **Arvind:**
> Have you ever used a lie detector? In the 1920s, William and Elizabeth Marston invented an early prototype of this device.
>
> Now, they were quite an interesting couple. Both were accomplished psychologists, and attorneys, and inventors. And if that wasn’t enough, William also wrote plots for comic books.
>
> Now, all the superheroes of his time were these muscular, macho male characters who mostly used their brute strength to win their battles. William wanted to change this. He wanted his superhero to win with wit, charm, and love.
>
> Elizabeth gave him an idea. Why don’t you make your superhero a superheroine? William loved this idea, rolled up his sleeves and got down to work.
>
> As he created this character, William wrote an introduction for her. Over 80 years ago, back in 1941, that read as such:
>
> "We are creating her to combat the idea that women are inferior to men, and to inspire girls to self-confidence in athletics, occupations, and professions otherwise monopolized by men. The only hope for civilization is the greater freedom, development, and equality of women in all fields of human activity."
>
> What powerful words, right?
>
> Now, that lie detector William and Elizabeth had invented? That would go on to become one of their superheroines’ primary weapons. The lie detector, when strapped on, would identify if someone wasn’t telling the truth.
>
> Just like the Lasso of Truth! Anyone bound by it would have no choice but to tell the truth to the superheroine who held it.
>
> William and Elizabeth Marston’s spectacular creation: Wonder Woman.[^2]

> **Arvind:**
> In 2011, the tsunami that struck Japan was amongst the most devastating in history. There were over 30,000 casualties with nearly a million homes destroyed across hundreds of villages.
>
> Only one village was spared from the devastation – Fudai. This was because of a 51-foot extended floodgate that stood firm, protecting the village from those deadly waves. Remarkably, this floodgate had been erected over 40 years earlier in 1972.
>
> It had cost the village about 30 million, a major expense that the villagers had held as a total waste of public funds. But the floodgate was built all the same. Why? Because the long-standing village mayor of 40 years had insisted upon it. Kotaku Wamura-san.
>
> The villagers initially challenged his opinion. Some made fun of him. Some even accused him of personal gains. But he stood firm.
>
> You see, he still remembered how, when he was a young man in 1933, a raging tsunami had demolished the northeast coast. How he had witnessed bodies being dug up from under soil and seaweed. It had claimed over 400 humans. He had sworn that not a single one of Fudai’s 3,000 residents would ever face such a scenario.
>
> Wamura-san retired in 1987, three years after the floodgate was completed. For his retirement, the village offered only silence. No celebration for his 40 years of dedicated service. He passed away in 1997.
>
> The residents’ reaction was colder still. No tears, no songs.
>
> In 2011, when the tsunami struck without warning, it was Wamura-san’s floodgate that saved Fudai. In the days that followed, the entire village climbed to his grave, heads bowed, tears flowing freely, whispering apologies and gratitude to the man they had once shunned.
>
> Too often, we ignore the voices of elders, not seeing the weight of the storms they’ve already faced.[^3]
