[Unknown Speaker A] Sir, can a gentleman be rude if required?
[Unknown Speaker B] So a gentleman is easily identified by his poise, his restraint, his ability to remain composed even under provocation. A gentleman will therefore abstain from rudeness of any and all sort. However, there are moments when being firm requires being vocal. Trolls, for instance, are best left ignored. Though I usually am known to indulge in a spot of fun with this vacuous variety. On a serious note, if rudeness is the only language a bully understands, a gentleman will speak it fluently and without apology. These are moments, however, that do not arise from anger or arrogance. They appear on account of principle. A gentleman's rudeness is never reckless. It is intentional and it is measured. And a gentleman will always speak with clarity, not cruelty. Now, what could be some of the instances that demand such clarity? To speak for the vulnerable, the voiceless, for those weaker than the self. To put an end to gossip, lies, and definitely slander of those known to him. When someone mistakes his decency for weakness. To stand against disrespect to those around him or to the self. When his own dignity is being compromised, to defend what he stands for, his personal code. In any such circumstance, a gentleman will meet cruelty with an equally rude, if not harder blow. None of his decisions though will be influenced by his ego. And after this rudeness is done with, a gentleman will not gloat. He will not revisit it with pride. He will not revisit it at all, in fact. Remember, as a gentleman, you will not let go of your usual grace because you momentarily forgot who you are, because you remember precisely what you stand for.
