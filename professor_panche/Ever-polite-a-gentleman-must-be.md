[Unknown Speaker A] Arvind, what are the words a gentleman must avoid?
[Arvind] While wit and charm are essential for every gentleman, his genuine distinction remains in what he chooses not to say. Rather than individual words, I'm going to take a wider sweep here. Your expression is a powerful device, Hari. It can build an image or unravel it entirely. Here's what I believe every gentleman must avoid. Vulgarity. Crude words cheapen speech. If used flippantly, they point to a lack of self-control. If employed with deliberate intention, it signals disrespect. Dismissiveness and condescension. Words that are demeaning, mocking, or humiliating are entirely unbecoming, irrespective of whether directed at a stranger or a friend. A gentleman knows that such words, they're failures of character. Boastfulness. A gentleman does not trumpet. He doesn't need to. His actions, his presence, and his silence speaks louder. Confidence is always quiet. Bragging about the self only dilutes one's dignity. Gossip. Empty talk about anyone, particularly when they're not present, reflects more on the speaker than it does on the subject. Dishonesty. Refrain from untruths of any scale. It demolishes trust. Anything said in a rage. Words can shatter relationships, leave lovers scarred, friends gone. A gentleman picks his words with due reverence. Words cannot be unsaid. A gentleman will not lash out even when wounded. Insincere flattery. A gentleman's praises are always meaningful. He would rather say nothing than what is untrue. Your words are your legacy, Hari. Guard them daily with a carefully observed sense of honor.
